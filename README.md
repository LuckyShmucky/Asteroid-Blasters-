# Asteroid-Blasters-
A lot of the inspiration for this game comes from Galactica. 
Growing up I played Galactica on a emulator with my Dad.

I felt that using an actual ship and having asteroids fall from the top of the screen and move towards the ship at the bottom would be too complicated for my current skill level. Instead I decided to use event listeners to wait for the player to click the asteroids which adds one point to the current score. I know we had a past assignment that had a bonus where we could try to incorporate hit detection, however, I found that bonus to be one of the most difficult.

The background Image is from Adobe Stock.

Once I chose the background Image I used the dev tools to find the Hex color of the background image and chose a color pallet I thought looked nice.

As of 2/14/2022 I would say that some of the spacing still needs work. For example: the card where I credit myself needs better spacing from the beige area above it and to the left. I still want to add a way to save each score to the local storage in the browser, but instead of actual points I think I want to save how long it took the player to destroy enough asteroids to win the game.
